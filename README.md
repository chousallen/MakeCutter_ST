# MakeCutter_ST
Try to use STM32 to control all the devices in the Cutter.

I try to use esp32 to control each of the device to check how to control the device by 3.3v MCU before directly utilize STM32. 
The files are in the folder "ESP32_test"

The ST MCU I use is STM32-NUCLEO-C031C6 which I borrowed from ST during 2024 MakeNTU contest.
